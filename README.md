Main goal: to predict which item on average has the best outcome when investing.
This project takes old data from the game Path of Exile and uses the currency market.
We analyze data and look for trends in order to find out which items hold value and which drop.
The currency data is centered around giving and receiving the currency "Chaos Orbs" which is Path of Exile's most versatile and common currency.
